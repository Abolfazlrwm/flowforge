## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

> Not tagged. Blocked on Docker verification by the project owner.

### Added

- Initial repository structure and Django 5.1 project (`flowforge` package).
- PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ integration via `django-environ`.
- Environment-specific settings package: `flowforge/settings/{base,dev,test,prod}.py`.
- Celery configuration for distributed task processing (interim — see ADR-007).
- Liveness (`/health/live/`) and readiness (`/health/ready/`) endpoints.
- Readiness checks PostgreSQL (`SELECT 1`), Redis (cache round-trip) and
  RabbitMQ (broker TCP connect).
- `uv.lock` with a resolved, pinned dependency graph.
- Ruff, mypy (strict), pytest, pytest-cov, and pre-commit configuration.
- GitHub Actions CI: lock-file check, lint, format, mypy, migration check,
  unit tests against PostgreSQL + Redis services, and a Docker build job.
- All GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs.
- Dependabot configuration for `uv`, GitHub Actions, and Docker.
- Docker Compose stack with healthchecks and `service_healthy` dependencies.
- Multi-stage Dockerfile running as a non-root `flowforge` user, with
  `.dockerignore`.
- MkDocs configuration.
- `docs/adr/` with ADR-007 (Celery as interim infrastructure).
- `docs/development/NAMING_ANALYSIS.md` recording the "FlowForge" name conflicts.
- Apache-2.0 license and initial documentation.

### Changed

- Health endpoint split into separate liveness and readiness probes.
- Settings split from a single module into per-environment modules.
- `SECRET_KEY` is now required whenever `DEBUG` is off; `prod.py` additionally
  rejects keys shorter than 50 characters and known placeholder prefixes.
- CI now installs from `uv.lock` via `uv sync --locked`.
- Docker image no longer installs development dependencies.
- `pyproject.toml` `source`/`packages` paths corrected to the real layout
  (`flowforge/`, `core/`, `api/`).

### Fixed

- `ruff format --check` failures in `asgi.py`, `wsgi.py`, `manage.py`
  (single quotes → double quotes).
- Coverage `source` pointing at a non-existent `src/` directory, which made
  every run report 0% and fail the 80% gate.
- Missing `pytest-cov` in dev dependencies while `--cov` was used in CI.
- Missing `.ruff_cache/` in `.gitignore`.
- Missing `.dockerignore`.
- Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` pointing at the removed `/health/` endpoint.
- Missing production security settings (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`,
  `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`,
  `SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY`).
- Broken `[project.scripts]` entry point referencing a non-existent `cli.main`.
- Migration check and Docker build were absent from CI.

### Removed

- "TaskForge" rename. An earlier draft renamed the project without owner
  approval; the rename has been fully reverted and the project remains
  "FlowForge".
